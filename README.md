# &spades; _Stripe Local_

A rails engine that maintains a local store of all your Stripe resources, keeping everything up to date with Stripe via their API and Webhook service.
Manages the complexities of keeping two data sources in sync while providing the speed and simplicity of dealing with purely local data in a purely synchronous fashion.

## <b style="color:red;">[</b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION<b style="color:red;">]</b>     Not in running condition!

StripeLocal is an attempt at extracting a framework for Stripe Integration that I have found myself building into several large scale CRM projects.  It is my first Rails Engine and I am still learning the ends and outs of Engine building. If you find something I am doing terribly wrong, please bring it to my attention by opening an issue. I appreciate your help.

#### Feel free to fork and hack.  I'm also happy to accept pull requests...
